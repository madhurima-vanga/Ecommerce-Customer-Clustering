**Insights and Recommendations**:

From Kmeans clusters we have seen that group-1 are from age groups - Under 18, 18-24; group-2 are from age groups 25-34, group-0 are from 35-44.
- Group - 0 characteristics
  - age 35-44
  - 3+ pairs of running shoes, some that are used for training and others that are used to race.
  - 5+ pairs of running shoes depending on the type of training and racing.
- Group - 1 characteristics
  - age Under 18, 18-24
  - A single pair that is used to go running in and also used for other activities
  - 1 pair of running shoes that are only used to run in
- Group - 2 characteristics
  - age 25-34
- It looks like age group is a driving factor for people behaviours and purchases, I would recommend the company teams to analyze more on how different other characteristics of these groups are and how they are buying
- They can develop marketing events/material etc. based on group specific characteristics and broadly based on age groups
- Also, if there is more data to analyze we can interpret the behaviour more well. So, would recommend the company to also collect more data, as we only have 175 records in the data currently
