**Insights and Recommendations**:
From Kmeans clusters we have seen that
- Group-1 are from age groups - Under 18, 18-24; group-2 are from age groups 25-34, group-0 are from 35-44.
- Group - 0
  - age 35-44
  - 3+ pairs of running shoes, some that I use for training and others that I use to race.
  - 5+ pairs of running shoes depending on the type of training and racing that I'm doing.
- Group - 1
 - age Under 18, 18-24
- Group - 2
  - age 25-34

- It looks like age group is a driving factor for people behaviours and purchases, I would recommend the company teams to analyze more on how different other characteristics of these groups are and how they are buying
- They can design marketing things based on those specific charactyeristics and broadly on age groups.


- Also, if there is more data to analyze we can interpret the behaviour more well. So, would recommend the company to also collect more data
